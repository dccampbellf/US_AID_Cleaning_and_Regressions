
In this project I want to run a regression comparing the effectiveness of US aid in global terms, 
across implementing agencies (USAID, State Department, Dept. of the Interior, etc.) and the effect 
it has on Human Development Index per country. I do this by accesing a database from explorer.usaid.gov 
and population data from the UN and adapting it to my needs (cleaning, rea-aligning, etc.).

Second, I want to run a regression comparing aid implemented by USAID per sector and compare it's 
effectiveness compared to Agriculture aid. Again, I used a database from explorer.usaid.gov and adapted it to my needs.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to upload one of the csv's - us_foreign_aid_complete. However, this document is easily retrievable
from https://explorer.usaid.gov/data.
